# 🙏 Gratitude Journal App – Full Stack Cloud Project

Welcome to the **Gratitude Journal App**, a minimal yet meaningful full-stack project designed and developed from scratch — covering **requirement gathering, UI/UX, Frontend, Backend (Java), DevOps, and Cloud Deployment**.

This project is a perfect showcase of how a simple idea can evolve into a **real, production-ready app** using modern tools and clean design.

## 📌 1. Business Requirement Gathering

### 🎯 Problem Statement:
In our busy lives, we often forget to appreciate small moments. A daily reminder to express gratitude can improve mental clarity, emotional strength, and overall happiness.

### 📝 Goal:
Create a **web application** where users can:
- Write 1 gratitude message daily
- View previous entries
- Delete entries if needed

### 💡 Constraints:
- One form, one entity: Keep it simple
- Design-first approach
- Deploy on cloud with CI/CD
- End-to-end ownership from concept to deployment

## 🎨 2. UI/UX Design

### 🔧 Tools Used:
- Figma for wireframes and visual prototyping
- Color palette: Soft, calming tones (e.g., pastel blues & whites)
- Font: Clean, readable typography (e.g., Poppins or Roboto)
