# High-Level Design (HLD) – Gratitude Journal App

This HLD document outlines the high-level architecture, current implementation, and roadmap for the Gratitude Journal App, including short-term and long-term enhancements, aligned with the ultimate vision.

## 1. Present Architecture (Version 1.0)

### Application Type

* Single entity journaling app
* Monolithic design with modular layers

### Layers

* **User Interface (UI)**: Responsive frontend with a gratitude form and history page
* **Interaction Layer**: Gateway that receives and handles API requests
* **Processing Layer**: Core logic for validation, transformation, and business rules
* **Persistence Layer**: Data store operations and interaction with a cloud-hosted database
* **CI/CD**: Automated pipeline for testing and deployment to a cloud provider

### Core Features

* Add daily gratitude entry
* View all entries
* Delete an entry
* Confirmation message and clean feedback UI

---

## 2. Short-Term Goals (Version 1.1 – 1.3)

### Objective: Enhance functionality, UX, and observability

#### 2.1 Features

* Add journaling streak tracker (daily habit streak)
* Add timestamps (HH\:MM) and sentiment tagging
* Sort entries by date and time
* Search and filter entries (e.g., keywords, mood)

#### 2.2 UX Improvements

* Autosave drafts
* Form validations and error messages
* Improve mobile responsiveness

#### 2.3 DevOps Enhancements

* Set up monitoring (e.g., logs, uptime alerts)
* Improve container startup time
* Enable rollback deployment versions

#### Milestones

* **M1**: Habit streak & tagging features
* **M2**: UI/UX responsiveness and feedback updates
* **M3**: DevOps enhancements and metrics dashboard

---

## 3. Long-Term Goals (Version 2.0+)

### Objective: Scale app into a multi-user platform with analytics

#### 3.1 Multi-user Capability

* User registration/login
* Secure user data segregation
* JWT-based authentication

#### 3.2 Advanced Features

* Analytics dashboard (e.g., entry frequency, peak gratitude hours)
* AI-generated prompts and motivational quotes
* Export as PDF or share to social media

#### 3.3 Cloud Evolution

* Move to microservices (entry service, user service, analytics service)
* Use managed DB with read-replica
* Load-balanced container orchestration

#### Milestones

* **M4**: Authentication & account management
* **M5**: Analytics and prompt generation
* **M6**: Microservice refactoring & horizontal scaling

## 4. Ultimate Purpose

The Gratitude Journal App is not just a form-based diary — it is a platform to:

* Build positive mental habits
* Enable long-term journaling behavior
* Offer data-driven emotional insights
* Provide a peaceful, minimal, distraction-free interface

The ultimate goal is to make the app available as a personal wellness tool, used by individuals and therapists globally, eventually offering value-added services like cloud sync, guided reflections, and private journaling groups.

## 5. HLD Summary

| Layer     | Responsibility                                           |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| UI        | Minimal input-based journaling experience                |
| Gateway   | API endpoints and routing                                |
| Processor | Input processing and journaling rules                    |
| Store     | Handles data persistence and queries                     |
| CI/CD     | Auto-deployment to the cloud provider on each commit     |
| Cloud     | Runs the deployed container and provides external access |

---

This HLD sets the direction for evolving the Gratitude Journal App from a single-user monolithic app to a cloud-native, multi-user, analytics-driven emotional wellness platform.
