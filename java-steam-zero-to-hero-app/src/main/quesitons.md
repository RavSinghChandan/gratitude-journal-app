2. Find the second highest number in a list
3. Count occurrence of each element in a list
4. Find frequency of characters in a String
5. Get only even/odd numbers from an integer list
6. Reverse each word in a sentence
7. Convert List<Integer> to comma-separated String
8. Sort a list in reverse order
9. Find the first non-repeating character
10. Merge two lists and remove duplicates

## ðŸ”¹ Map & Grouping
11. Group Employees by Department
12. Count employees in each department
13. Find the highest salary employee in each department
14. Convert List<Employee> to Map<Id, Employee>

---

## ðŸ”¹ Advanced Aggregation & Reduction
16. Calculate the sum of salaries
17. Calculate the average salary by department
18. Find employee with nth highest salary
19. Partition list into pass/fail based on score
20. Use custom Collector for reduction (e.g., join strings, custom logic)

---

## ðŸ”¹ FlatMap Challenges
21. Flatten a List<List<String>> into a single List<String>

---

## ðŸ”¹ Edge Cases & Tricky
27. Demonstrate lazy evaluation and short-circuiting
28. Use parallel streams effectively
29. Explain stateful vs stateless operations
30. Show how order matters in streams
31. Use Optional within a Stream pipeline
32. Compare Collector vs reducing with examples
33. Handle exceptions within a Stream lambda
34. Use `peek()` for debugging pipelines
